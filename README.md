# 🍺 BeerBru: Your Brewing Assistant 🍺
BeerBru is a Streamlit-based application designed to assist home brewers through each stage of the beer brewing process. From selecting your grain bill to calculating mash and sparge water, hop additions, and estimating the final ABV, BeerBru simplifies your brewing process with easy-to-use calculations and guidance.

## 📝 Features
- Recipe Details: Select your beer-style batch size and specify a detailed grain bill.
- Mashing Process: Calculate the mash water volume and strike water temperature based on your desired mash temperature and water-to-grain ratio.
- Sparging Process: Estimate the required sparge water volume to reach your target batch size.
- Boil & Hop Additions: Plan hop additions with boil times to fine-tune bitterness and flavour.
- Fermentation Process: Set your primary and secondary fermentation conditions, including temperature and duration.
- ABV Calculation: Estimate the Alcohol by Volume (ABV) based on the original and final gravity readings.
